        <span>2019 - 2020 </span>

        <p class="timeline-text">
          After my higher secondary education, I embarked on a challenging journey, participating in entrance exams such as NEET, JEE, WBJEE, and JEE Advanced. Regrettably, I faced several setbacks. Despite my efforts, I couldn't secure a spot in a government medical college through NEET. However, I did qualify for take into participate in JEE Advance Through JEE, only to falter due to a misguided strategy of attempting all questions, leading to my failure.
          <span>  </span>
          Additionally, my ego prevented me from seeking counseling for NITs or IIITs through JEE. In the case of WBJEE, I secured a seat in Food Technology but yearned to pursue computer engineering, leading me to forfeit my seat. Subsequently, I enrolled in BSc Microbiology at Bidhannagar College but changed my mind and canceled my admission.
          <span>  </span>
          Undeterred, I attempted NEET again, scoring 350 marks, which weren't sufficient for a government medical college. Finally, I found my calling in Computer Science at Balurghat College. Remarkably, I navigated this tumultuous journey independently, without formal coaching. Despite these challenges and redirections, my commitment to excel in the field of computer science remains unwavering.
